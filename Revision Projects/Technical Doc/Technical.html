                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. 
                    HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. 
                    A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. 
                    This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. 
                    Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

                    Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
                    CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. 
                    It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
                    While html uses tags, css uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

                    JavaScript Introduction<br>
                    JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. 
                    It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. 
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 
                    Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
                    Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. 
                    Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.
                    Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. 
                    The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js. Imperative language. In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done. 
                    It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call.
                    Declarative programming. In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical computation require . Here  main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it like  arrow function do .

                    jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript.
                    Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.
                    The only library available today that meets the needs of both designer types and programmer types is jQuery.
                    jQuery is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more.” This philosophy can be further elaborated as three concepts:
                    Finding some elements (via CSS selectors) and doing something with them (via jQuery methods) i.e. locate a set of elements in the DOM, and then do something with that set of elements.
                    Chaining multiple jQuery methods on a set of elements, Using the jQuery wrapper and implicit iteration

                <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. 
                    It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. 
                    It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, 
                    the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). 
                    All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project. 
                    Bootstrap has evolved many versions and every time when we want to use this framework we can select the version which we want to use.

                    A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has one or more distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and replicating the data it holds.
                    Other kinds of data stores can also be used, such as files on the file system or large hash tables in memory but data fetching and writing would not be so fast and easy with those type of systems.
                    Nowadays, we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store and manage huge volume of data. This is called relational database because all the data is stored into different tables and relations are established using primary keys or other keys known as Foreign Keys.
                    A Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS) is a software that, Enables you to implement a database with tables, columns and indexes.
                    Guarantees the Referential Integrity between rows of various tables. Updates the indexes automatically. Interprets an SQL query and combines information from various tables.
